Business Value quite simply put is what value business will achieve from a particular product/project. This is very closely linked the initial value proposition of a project and it's business motivation. To ensure a successful project we need to define it's purpose and what business value will be achieved through it, a projects success is then measured by how successfully this was achieved in a certain time frame.

Business value can be anything from competitive advantage (first to market) through to actual bottom line revenue, as such it has a broad definition and tends to be tangible.
