The final stage of approval prior to go live is called UAT, "User Acceptance Testing" or simply acceptance testing. This ensures that the project team has delivered the product against not just the project specification but it also has received the acceptance of the end user - ie, it is fit for purpose. 

Unfortunately this can also be a fairly emotive part of product development because often end users don't know what they want until you show them what they don't want, handling rejections at this stage needs to be done cautiosly , any rejection reasons need to be carefully analysed and acted on.
