Stakeholders are basically anyone that has an interest in the project/product. One of the trickier things in product development is understanding the various roles the stakeholders play and their individual motivations - for instance the designer's motivation on product development is going to be completely different to the CEO, one is driven by creating a beautiful product that is easy to use, looks great and is intuitive while the other could be driven by creating bottom line revenue and potentially creating a new market.

To better understand stakeholders it is a good idea to ask team members what their project/product motivations are up front, this may or may not reflect their actual intent but will give you a good starting point or baseline. That way it will be easier for you to understand their perspective during the course of the project and hopefully will lead to a better rounded product and smoother delivery.
