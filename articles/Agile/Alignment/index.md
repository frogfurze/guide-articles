One of the critical success factors in any business is the alignment of interests. In particular the alignment of IT and Business, if you don't understand what the business strategy is then it is very difficult to create a successful IT strategy to support that business. It is key to understand what business is focussing on over the next 6/12/60 months and then build a strategy to underpin that success from an IT side. 

As an example if the business is focussing on driving bottom line profit and leaning up the enterprise then it goes without saying that you need to shrink the IT spend, reduce capital expenditure and staffing costs to improve the ultimate bottom line results.
